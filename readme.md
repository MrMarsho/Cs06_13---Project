For the remaining updates this website we have, we aim to gather user-account data and use it to better our website's handling on the mental health 
scene of Pisay scholars. We will send a data collection surveys to some of our friends to ensure that there will be a broad scale and that the results will not just
be based on a specific group of people. This form will be about the students' mental health, their overall sleep schedule, and their procrastination levels
during important weeks such as the Periodical Exam Week, or "Hell Week" as it is more commonly known. Most importantly, we will ask them what exactly in 
school stresses them out the most, to find out what can be done so that their anxiety may lessen with the help of our website.

As of now, we have included minor updates in the "Mental Check-Up" and "Sources" pages. For the Mental Check-Up page, we decided to largen the switch background
button, as it might have been an inconvenience to press. Our bigger update, however, was adding another game, this time to the Sources page, inspired by Cookie Clicker.
While these updates may be substantial for the growth of the website, in the near future, we will also be adding a data storage page to keep track of the results
of our data-gathering.

Below are three examples of data-collection that we will use for our website:
1) Stress Level

{
  "StressLevels": {
    "studentsId": "unique-identifier",
    "DateofSubmission": "date",
    "StressLevel": "integer"  // Scaled from 1 to 10
  }
}

2) Subject Impact on Mental Health

{
  "SubjectsImpact": {
    "studentsId": "unique-identifier",
    "subject": "text-string",
    "ImpactScore": "integer",  // Scaled from 1 to 10
    "otherComments": "text-string"
  }
}

3) Social Interaction Data

{
  "SocialInteraction": {
    "studentsId": "unique-identifier",
    "DateofSubmission": "date",
    "interactionType": "text-string",
    "AverageDuration": "float",  // Duration in minutes
    "HappinessLevel": "integer",  // Scaled from 1 to 10
    "otherComments": "text-string"
  }
}
